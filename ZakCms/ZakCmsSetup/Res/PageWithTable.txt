The Notification Engine requires a number of components to be installed and configured as part of the setup process.

Required components:

- Pipeline
- GUI Shell
- Notification Engine

Whilst the Notification Engine can be installed on a single machine, the following minimum configuration is recommended for performance and security reasons:

<table class="table table-striped table-condensed">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>Qty</td>
            <td>Item</td>
            <td>Hardware, OS and Software Specifications</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Database Server</td>
            <td>Microsoft SQL Server Express or Enterprise edition (depending on number of users)<br />
            CPU, RAM and Disk Space to meet minimum requirements for selected Microsoft SQL Server edition (see above)<br />
            </td>
        </tr>
